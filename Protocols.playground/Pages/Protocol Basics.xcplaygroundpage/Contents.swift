//: # Protocols
//: Protocols are, as per Apple's definition in the _Swift Programming Language_ book:
//:
//: "... a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol."
//:
//: The below example shows a protocol that requires conforming types have a particular property defined.
// Our app needs the user's full name.
// We can write a protocol to make sure that anything that uses the protocol has a full name.

// Any Â´thing insed of this protocol becomes the requirements for anyone to follow these "rules"
